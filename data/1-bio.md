# Bio

As a Software Engineer and Technical Leader, I believe nearly anything is achievable with the right mindset, tools, and teamwork. Guided by my core values of humility, hard work, perseverance, sustainability, and transparency, I strive to make meaningful contributions and inspire others to do the same.

With extensive experience across both high-level architectural design and low-level code optimization, I enjoy solving complex problems by balancing vision with practical constraints. Whether I'm mentoring teams, building scalable systems, or diving into the nitty-gritty of debugging, my approach is always adaptable and goal-driven. 🛠️

What excites me most is helping others develop a comprehensive understanding of how software systems work, and I take pride in fostering a collaborative, learning-oriented environment. I believe in aiming for the ideal solution, and then iterating to make the best use of available resources – after all, success is more about direction than perfection. 🧭

My leadership experience includes driving projects in the NLP domain, collaborating cross-functionally, and designing systems that prioritize performance and scalability. I’ve also led teams in overcoming technical challenges, optimizing infrastructure, and introducing process improvements that ensure both quality and efficiency. 🧑‍💻

I am always excited about continuous learning—whether it’s tackling complex backend systems, experimenting with Machine Learning models, or picking up new skills through hands-on projects (currently working through AWS certifications and experimenting on Kaggle). 📚

And when I'm not immersed in code, I’m likely out on a run, cycling through the streets of Barcelona, or perhaps creating some Strava art to blend fitness with creativity. (Yes, you can find my “art” on my portfolio!) 🚴‍♂️🎨
